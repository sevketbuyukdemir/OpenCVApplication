# OpenCVApplication

This project is part of my project for my graduation project. It will be a good example for those who want to use the OpenCV library in Android applications. You can download and review the codes from the project link.
## Tip: Google Play Store dropped OpenCV support so you need to do a few things. Download Android Debug Bridge Tool (adb). Adb comes with Android Studio (platform-tools). Install the appropriate ".apk" file from the "OpenCV Manager.apk" files you downloaded from OpenCV's official site with this tool. The application will become operable. Good luck :)
